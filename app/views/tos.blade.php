		This service is provided with no guarantee whatsoever. Things may brake. We don't even know how to write proper ToS things, so you see, we are very unreliable. If you are not happy with it - please don't use the service.<br />
		We'll never give your email to anyone on purpose and we will try our best to not let anyone find out your email or anything like that. But we don't control aliens or government agencies or alike.
		If there is anything we can help you with - reach out to us via email (mail2sms.co@gmail.com) and let's talk.
